# Local_Server_Crud

CRUD with Node.js, MySQL, Express and EJS. Start this application in your terminal with “nodemon app.js”.

Focus here was the implementation of CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) logic. CSS and styling was not important at this point. This repository is intended to server as a guide, a quick reference for future projects.

Database is MySQL to which I connected via MAMP and Sequel Pro is used as a suite. NodeJS is used for the logic/requests/routes and EJS is used to serve our HTML pages.
